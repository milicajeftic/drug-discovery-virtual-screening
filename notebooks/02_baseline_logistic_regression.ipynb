    "## Goal of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes a **baseline logistic regression model** as a reference point for all subsequent models.\n",
    "The objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Preprocessed Data** – Import train/validation/test sets from notebook 01\n",
    "2. **Train Baseline Model** – Fit logistic regression on training data\n",
    "3. **Validate Performance** – Evaluate on validation set with comprehensive metrics\n",
    "4. **Test Evaluation** – Final unbiased evaluation on held-out test set\n",
    "5. **Baseline Summary** – Document strengths, limitations, and reference point\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Baseline model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)\n",
    "- Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations\n",
    "- Saved baseline model (joblib)\n",
    "- Baseline report (saved to `results/metrics/`)\n",
